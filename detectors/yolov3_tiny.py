    There are two options for getting a detector's results:
    Either get_confidence_score() OR get_objects_of_interest()

    get_confidence_score() must return a confidence level from 0.00 to 1.00.
    This represents how confident the detector is that
    something is out of the ordinary.

    get_objects_of_interest() returns a list of tuples, where each object
    is formatted like this:
    (object_name, object_type, object_confidence)
